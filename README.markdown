# Less-Than XML


* *Element:* any XML Element


### Building XML Elements

strophejs' XML Builder is very convenient for producing XMPP
stanzas. node-xmpp includes it in a much more primitive way: the
`c()`, `cnode()` and `t()` methods can be called on any *Element*
object, returning the new child element.

This can be confusing: in the end, you will hold the last-added child
until you use `up()`, a getter for the parent. `Connection.send()`
first invokes `tree()` to retrieve the uppermost parent, the XMPP
stanza, before sending it out the wire.


## TODO

* More documentation
* More tests (Using [Vows](http://vowsjs.org/))
